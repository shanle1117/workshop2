# FAIX AI Chatbot (Brief)

This project contains the FAIX AI Chatbot for student assistance. Key points:

- Core modules are under `modules/` (conversation manager & knowledge base).
- Data files should live under `data/`.
- Frontend assets are under `frontend/`.
- Tests live under `tests/`.

Run the demo conversation manager:

```bash
python modules/conversation_manager.py
```

Simple KB test:

```bash
python tests/test_chatbot.py
```

If you want this short README to replace the main `README.md`, tell me and I will update/replace it.
